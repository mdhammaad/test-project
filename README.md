# Analysis of airline
This project analyzes airline flight data to uncover insights into flight distribution, pricing patterns, and schedule trends. Using Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), it performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize the data. The project focuses on identifying variations in flight frequency and pricing, supporting data-driven decisions for airline management.
